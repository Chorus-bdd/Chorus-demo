===========

Some simple Chorus examples

These are best run as a JUnit test suite 
(Chorus includes a JUnit runner which presents Chorus features as JUnit tests)

To run these, either:

- Run the JUnit suite AllChorusTests.java from your IDE with JUnit support
- Run the ant task 'test' from any IDE with support for Apache Ant
- Run the ant task 'test' from the command line once you have installed Ant into your PATH

Feature: Step Macro Two

  Here we show how to reuse a sequence of steps as a step macro
  Step macros are a Chorus extension to the Gherkin BDD syntax
  A local step macro is defined which adds two numbers, and this is used twice from the feature
  The step macro could alternatively go into a file with the extension .stepmacro, to share it with other feature files.
